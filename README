This should serve as a place to retain a default CakePHP app WITH more bells and whistles pre-installed and configured than that of the default CakePHP app.

So far this default App includes:

=INSTALLATION=
To install, simply clone cakePHP and replace it's app folder with a copy of this repo. This will jump start you right into twitter bootstrap using LESS. 

=LESS=
I have added a default LESS file called "twibo.less". Simply compile the bootstrap.less file with your favorite LESS compiler. My favorite is lessc and seems to work best for this application. 

Compiled your css file into the CSS folder and name it bootstrap.min.css, This is the command in lessc

`lessc bootstrap.less ../css/bootstrap.min.css --yui-compress`


=Features=
--Twitter Bootstrap
--LESS
--Jquery 1.7.2
--New Homepage (That ACTUALLY makes sense, from Twitter Bootstrap)
